## Online Retail Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This repository contains the code and analysis for an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project conducted on the online retail dataset. The goal of this project is to gain insights into customer behavior, product performance, and market trends to inform strategic decision-making.

# Key Findings:
-   The project revealed a significant skew in the distribution of order quantities, with most orders being for small quantities.
-   A positive correlation was observed between order quantity and total sales, as expected.
-   The relationship between unit price and revenue was less clear and requires further investigation.
-   The United Kingdom emerged as the largest market, but sales performance in other countries warrants further analysis.
-   Customer segmentation based on purchase frequency can be used to identify distinct buyer behaviors.
-   The project identified the most profitable product categories and explored potential factors contributing to their success.

# Code Structure:
The codebase is organized as follows:

[Online Retail.xlsx](<Online Retail.xlsx>): This directory contains the raw cleaned online retail dataset.

[Online Retail_EDA}_lite.ipynb](<Online Retail_EDA}_lite.ipynb>): This directory houses the Python scripts used for data cleaning, exploration, and visualization.

[Online Retail.pbix](<Online Retail.pbix>): This contains the Powerbi Dashboard File.

[documentation](Cleaning notes and Plan.docx): This contains some thought processes during EDA.

[README.md](README.md): This file provides an overview of the project.

# Getting Started:
1. Clone the repository: 
git clone https://github.com/HachikaruAnyakwee/Online_Retail_EDA
2. Install dependencies: 
pip install -r [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)
3. Run the analysis scripts:
Navigate to the [Online Retail_EDA}_lite.ipynb](<Online Retail_EDA}_lite.ipynb>) directory and run the Python scripts individually or create a script to execute them sequentially.

# Further Exploration:
This project provides a foundation for further exploration of the online retail data. Here are some potential areas for future investigation:
-   Analyze customer churn and identify factors contributing to customer loss.
-   Develop predictive models to forecast future sales and demand.
-   Explore the use of machine learning algorithms for product recommendation and customer segmentation.

# Feel free to contribute to this project by:
-   Forking the repository and proposing improvements.
-   Extending the analysis to explore new aspects of the data.
-   Sharing your findings and insights with the community.
